However, the movie has so much energy that it's thoroughly enjoyable.", "The music, the performances, the precision in capturing the post-college malaise -- The Graduate's coming-of-age story is indeed one for the ages.", "Starkly emotional and beautifully directed, The Selfish Giant uses a lovely script and some powerful performances to present some of the best that modern British cinema has to offer.", "The Hunting Ground isn't director Kirby Dick's strongest work as a filmmaker, but the movie's powerful message more than trumps any technical weaknesses.", "It's a tale tastefully told and beautifully filmed, but Water for Elephants suffers from a pronounced lack of chemistry between its leads.", "While far from Disney's greatest film, Tangled is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio's classic animated canon.", "Despite the relaxed, easy chemistry of stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, Larry Crowne is surprisingly bland and conventional.", "A well-crafted retelling of an epic true story, Kon Tiki is a throwback to old-school adventure filmmaking that's exciting and entertaining in spite of its by-the-book plotting.", "Funny People features

plot and lack of heart.", "With Clint Eastwood in the lead, Ennio Morricone on the score, and Sergio Leone's stylish direction, For a Few Dollars More earns its recognition as a genre classic.", "By turns fluffy and biting, this show biz comedy is given girth by comic heavyweight John Malkovich and made all the more charming by Emily Blunt.", "The Cat's Meow is a deliciously evoked period piece and whodunit.", "Greatly benefiting from the tremendous chemistry between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, Open Range is a sturdy modern Western with classic roots.", "Incoherent, silly, and unoriginal, The New Guy offers up the same old teen gross-out comedy cliches.", "A slick and well-made thriller that takes on new weight due to the current political climate.", "With a predictable and

powerful performances, and empathetic direction.", "Deft direction and strong performances from its all-female cast guide The Descent, a riveting, claustrophobic horror film.", "Tony Scott tries to combine action, science fiction, romance, and explosions into one movie, but the time travel conceit might be too preposterous and the action falls apart under scrutiny.", "Writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait's first foray into horror doesn't break any new ground, but it does wring fresh terror from a well-worn genre formula -- and offers a few nasty laughs in the bargain.", "A charming family-friendly movie with stunning cinematography.", "Austere, finely crafted, and compelling.", "Ponderous and overlong, The Majestic drowns in forced sentimentality and resembles a mish-mash of other, better films.", "Neil LaBute's pitch-black comedy is a masterful exploration of male insecurity, and it's elevated by a breakout performance by Aaron Eckhart as a businessman who likes to play psychological games.", "The underwater footage is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.", "Roll Bounce dazzles us with a classic late 1970's feel, but this coming of age film could have been more than just a spin around the roller rink.", "Mean Creek is an uncomfortably riveting glimpse into the casual cruelty of youth.", "Director Adrian Shergold doesn't shy away from the darker elements of the movie's subject, and Timothy Spall is mesmerizing as the title character.", "A wonderful cast and top-notch script elevate The Great Debaters beyond a familiar formula for a touching, uplifting
